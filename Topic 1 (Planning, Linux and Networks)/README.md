# Topic 1 (Planning, Linux and Networks)

> Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative - DevOps Track

## Planning

Planning is the first stage (phase) in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) during which we analyze project requirements and prepare the software and environment.

As the DevOps engineer in this stage, you may be asked to help with

- Preparing the environment: installing any needed operating systems, services, and software.
- Writing technical documentation (ideas, guides, or architectural documents).
- Administering a project dashboard: creating/assigning tasks.

Let us prepare for such tasks by focusing on these topics.

- [MarkDown](https://hackmd.io): the most popular markup language
  - Used mainly to write technical documentation involving code snippets.
- [Trello](https://trello.com/): popular, easy-to-use project management tool.
- [Draw.io](https://draw.io) popular, easy-to-use tool for creating diagrams.
